# 2026-02-08 — Bon Secours Dublin personalisation pack

## What I learned
- Bon Secours Hospital Dublin has strong public signals around planned care and operational quality (HIQA inspection report, endoscopy scale, recent day-ward investment).
- A credible first outreach is easier when you can cite a small number of high-confidence, public operational facts (hospital model, bed count, key service lines) without drifting into sensitive detail.

## What I built / shipped
- A public snapshot file you can pull from when writing tailored outreach: `roadmap/outreach/bon-secours-dublin-snapshot.md`.
- Updated the pilot taster briefs to be Bon Secours Dublin-specific and re-generated the styled PDFs locally.
- Added a generator flag to set the title-page overline so each PDF can carry the hospital name: `--overline "Bon Secours Dublin"`.

## Notes from conversations (non-sensitive)
- We’re leading with a 4–6 week pilot offering: analyse workflows, assess AI readiness, and propose a safe deployment approach.
- We’re targeting Bon Secours Dublin first.

## Next steps
- Choose one wedge for the first thread (theatre cancellations vs outpatients DNAs vs diagnostics flow).
- Decide the first three recipients (CEO + Business Manager + Clinical Director tends to work well in private hospitals).
- Send email 1 and LinkedIn connect notes on the same day; follow up with the relevant taster PDF attached.
