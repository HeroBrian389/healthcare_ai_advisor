# 2026-02-06 — Repo created

## What I learned
- Set up a public progress log repo using GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## What I built / shipped
- Initial repository structure: `progress/`, `roadmap/`, `resources/`.

## Notes from conversations (non-sensitive)
- This repo’s purpose is to track my journey toward national-scale AI leadership in Ireland (starting with healthcare).

## Next steps
- Define 3–5 clear milestones for “AI advisor readiness” in `roadmap/README.md`.
- Add an initial reading list in `resources/README.md`.
