# AI Tsar (Ireland) — Progress Log

This repository is a personal log of my progress toward becoming the **AI “tsar” for Ireland (or similar)** — a national-level advisor/leader who can shape strategy and deliver real-world AI outcomes, starting from healthcare.

## What you'll find here

- `progress/`: Weekly / monthly updates (what I learned, built, and shipped)
- `roadmap/`: Structured learning plan + milestone checklists
- `resources/`: Reading list, links, notes, and reference material

## Focus

- **Practical outcomes**: Prefer short write-ups with concrete deliverables (prototypes, memos, checklists).
- **Ireland-first context**: Learn the local ecosystem, regulations, and procurement realities.
- **National-scale thinking**: Connect policy, governance, and delivery.

## How I’ll track progress

Each update should answer:

1. What did I learn?
2. What did I build or document?
3. What conversations did I have (non-sensitive summaries)?
4. What’s next?
