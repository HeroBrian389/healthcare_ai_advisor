# Healthcare AI Advisor (Ireland) — Progress Log

This repository is a personal log of my progress toward becoming an **AI advisor for hospitals across Ireland**.

## What you'll find here

- `progress/`: Weekly / monthly updates (what I learned, built, and shipped)
- `roadmap/`: Structured learning plan + milestone checklists
- `resources/`: Reading list, links, notes, and reference material

## Guiding principles

- **No patient data / PHI**: This repo should never contain identifiable patient information.
- **Practical outcomes**: Prefer short write-ups with concrete deliverables (prototypes, memos, checklists).
- **Ireland-first context**: Learn the local healthcare ecosystem, regulations, and procurement realities.

## How I’ll track progress

Each update should answer:

1. What did I learn?
2. What did I build or document?
3. What conversations did I have (non-sensitive summaries)?
4. What’s next?

Start here: `progress/README.md`
