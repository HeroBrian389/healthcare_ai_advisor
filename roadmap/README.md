# Roadmap

This roadmap is a lightweight checklist of skills and deliverables that map to national-scale AI leadership (starting with healthcare).

## Milestone 1 — Core healthcare + Ireland context
- Understand how Irish healthcare is organized (HSE, public vs private, major hospital groups)
- Learn common clinical workflows (ED, inpatient, outpatient, radiology, labs)
- Basics of health informatics (HL7 v2, FHIR, ICD-10, SNOMED)

## Milestone 2 — AI fundamentals for clinical settings
- Model basics: LLMs, RAG, evaluation, guardrails
- Risk management: bias, hallucinations, safety, human-in-the-loop
- Data basics: governance, quality, lineage, de-identification

## Milestone 3 — Governance, compliance, procurement
- Clinical safety case thinking (hazard analysis, mitigations, monitoring)
- Privacy + security fundamentals (data minimization, access controls, audit)
- Procurement reality: pilots, stakeholder alignment, ROI framing

## Milestone 4 — Delivery capability (prove it)
- Ship 2–3 small prototypes (synthetic data only)
- Write 2–3 advisory memos (e.g., “RAG for discharge summaries: risks + controls”)
- Build an evaluation harness for an LLM workflow (metrics + red teaming)

## Milestone 5 — Credibility + influence
- 10+ informational interviews (summaries only)
- Public artifacts: blog posts, talks, open-source examples
- Case studies (anonymized) demonstrating measured impact
