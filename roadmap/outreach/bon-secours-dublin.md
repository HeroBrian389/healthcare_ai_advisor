## Suggested outreach sequence

1. Use your strongest internal contact to get an intro to **CEO (Sharon Morrow)** or **Business Manager (Mary Houston)**.
2. Ask for a 30–45 min “AI opportunity mapping” call with **CEO + Clinical Director + DoN** (one workflow only).
3. Bring in **CIO/CISO** once the use-case and guardrails are agreed.

## Suggested wedge (pick one)

- Theatre utilisation + cancellations
- Radiology scheduling + report QA workflows
- Outpatients: DNA reduction + admin workload
- Nursing documentation improvement (with clear safety guardrails)
