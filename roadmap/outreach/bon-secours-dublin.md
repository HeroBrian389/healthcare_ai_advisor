## LinkedIn (useful for “the missing roles”)

The Bon Secours website lists senior leaders, but for roles like **IT Manager**, **Radiology Manager**, **Theatre Manager**, **Operations Manager**, etc., LinkedIn is often faster.

- Bon Secours Hospital Dublin on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bon-secours-hospital-dublin
- Bon Secours Health System Ireland on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bon-secours-health-system-ireland

Suggested searches:

- “Bon Secours Hospital Dublin IT Manager”
- “Bon Secours Hospital Dublin Radiology Manager”
- “Bon Secours Hospital Dublin Theatre Manager”
- “Bon Secours Hospital Dublin Quality Risk Manager”

## Suggested outreach sequence

1. Use your strongest internal contact to get an intro to **CEO (Sharon Morrow)** or **Business Manager (Mary Houston)**.
2. Ask for a 30–45 min “AI opportunity mapping” call with **CEO + Clinical Director + DoN** (one workflow only).
3. Bring in **CIO/CISO** once the use-case and guardrails are agreed.

## Suggested wedge (pick one)

- Theatre utilisation + cancellations
- Radiology scheduling + report QA workflows
- Outpatients: DNA reduction + admin workload
- Nursing documentation improvement (with clear safety guardrails)
