# Outreach templates (hospital AI advisory)

Last updated: 2026-02-06.

Use these as a base and *personalise* for each hospital.

Rules:

- Keep it **short** (<= 150 words for cold email).
- Offer a **single, low-risk pilot**.
- Make **governance + evaluation** part of the offer (that’s your differentiation).
- Avoid buzzwords (“transform”, “revolutionise”).

## Cold email — CEO / GM

Subject options:

- A small, low‑risk AI pilot for {{hospital}}
- Quick call: {{workflow}} (measurable, no PHI)

Hi {{name}},

I’m Brian Kelleher. I help hospitals run **small, safety‑first AI pilots** (one workflow) and I deliver the readiness + guardrails + evaluation plan so it’s safe to deploy.

For {{hospital}}, a strong early candidate is {{workflow}} (e.g., theatre cancellations / outpatient DNAs). In 4–6 weeks, the goal is to map the workflow end-to-end, identify constraints, implement a small prototype, and evaluate impact with a clear go/no-go.

Would you be open to a 25‑minute call next week? If someone else owns operational improvement/digital, I’m happy to route via them.

Best,
Brian

## Cold email — CIO / Digital / Transformation

Subject options:

- {{hospital}}: practical AI pilot + evaluation plan
- AI governance + vendor due diligence (hospital-grade)

Hi {{name}},

I’m Brian Kelleher. I work on hospital AI delivery that is defensible: **tight scope, low data risk, explicit limitations**, and an evaluation plan that makes stop/go decisions easy.

If {{hospital}} is exploring AI this year, I’d propose a 4–6 week pilot on one operational workflow ({{workflow}}), paired with readiness + governance (access controls, auditability, monitoring, vendor risk checks).

Could we do a 25‑minute call to see if there’s a fit?

Best,
Brian

## Cold email — Quality / Patient Safety

Subject options:

- Evaluating AI safely in {{hospital}} (pilot-first)
- Clinical safety posture for AI workflows (practical)

Hi {{name}},

I’m Brian Kelleher. I’m focused on **clinical safety + evaluation** for AI in hospital workflows: hazards, mitigations, metrics, and monitoring from day one.

If {{hospital}} is considering pilots, I’d love 20 minutes to align on what “safe” and “measurable” should mean before anything touches production workflows.

Best,
Brian

## LinkedIn — connect note (universal)

Hi {{name}} — I’m Brian Kelleher. I help Irish hospitals run small, low‑risk AI pilots (one workflow) with proper evaluation + governance. Would you be open to a brief call?

## LinkedIn — message after connecting

Thanks for connecting, {{name}}. I’m proposing a focused pilot ({{workflow}}) that stays low‑risk and includes an evaluation/safety posture from day one. If useful, I can send a 1‑page pilot outline. Would a short call suit?
