# Bon Secours Hospital Dublin (Glasnevin) — outreach drafts

Last updated: 2026-02-06.

Scope: **short, role-specific messages** you can send via email or LinkedIn.

Principles (keep it focused):

- **No PHI.** Start with operational/admin workflows (scheduling, cancellations, patient flow metadata).
- **One workflow, one pilot.** 4–6 weeks beats “AI transformation”.
- **Measured tone.** No hype. Be specific about risk controls.

Quick personalisation fields (fill once):

- `{{your_name}}`: Brian Kelleher
- `{{your_title}}`: (e.g., Independent AI advisor / Meridian)
- `{{your_phone}}`: (optional)
- `{{your_linkedin}}`: (optional)
- `{{your_cred}}`: 1 line (e.g., “I build evaluation + governance for clinical AI workflows.”)

Default pilot menu (pick **one** per thread):

- Theatre utilisation + cancellations
- Outpatients: DNAs + scheduling load
- Radiology workflow support (non-diagnostic, ops + QA)
- Nursing documentation/admin burden (safety-first)

## Sharon Morrow — CEO (Dublin)

Channel: email via `dublininfo@bonsecours.ie` (Attn: Sharon Morrow) and/or LinkedIn.

Subject options:

- Bon Secours Dublin: low‑risk AI pilot (one workflow)
- Quick call: theatre cancellations / scheduling (AI, no PHI)

Email draft:

Hi Sharon,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). `{{your_cred}}`.

I’m reaching out because Bon Secours Dublin looks like a strong candidate for a **small, low‑risk AI pilot** focused on a single operational workflow (e.g., theatre cancellations or outpatient DNAs) — **without touching patient notes**.

The shape I’m proposing is simple: a short discovery to map one workflow + agree guardrails (clinical leadership, IT/security), then a 4–6 week pilot that produces (1) a working prototype and (2) an evaluation plan you can actually trust.

If you’re open to it, could we do a 25–30 minute call next week? If someone else is better placed (ops / digital), I’m happy to route via them.

Best,

## Prof Steve Patchett — Clinical Director (Dublin)

Channel: email via `spatchettrooms@bonsecours.ie` (or LinkedIn).

Subject options:

- Question re: a small, safety‑first AI pilot (one workflow)
- Bon Secours Dublin: operational AI with clear clinical guardrails

Email draft:

Hi Prof Patchett,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). I’m working on practical, safety‑first AI adoption in Irish hospitals.

I’m exploring a **small pilot at Bon Secours Dublin** that stays firmly on the “low‑risk” side: operational workflows (scheduling, cancellations, admin load) and an evaluation plan that makes the limitations explicit. No diagnostic decision support.

If this is something you’d be open to, I’d value 25 minutes to sanity‑check which workflow would be clinically acceptable and who should be involved from the start (quality/safety, nursing, IT).

Best,
`{{your_name}}`
`{{your_phone}}`

LinkedIn message (after connecting):

Thanks for connecting, Prof Patchett. I’d like your guidance on a single, low‑risk operational AI pilot (no PHI, no diagnostics) with a clear evaluation + safety posture. Would a brief call suit?

## Celine McConnell — Director of Nursing (Dublin)

Channel: LinkedIn or email via `dublininfo@bonsecours.ie` (Attn: Director of Nursing).

Subject options:

- Nursing admin burden: small AI pilot (safety-first)
- Bon Secours Dublin: documentation + staffing support (no PHI)

Email draft:

Hi Celine,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). I work on AI adoption that reduces admin burden while keeping clinical safety and governance front-and-centre.

If Bon Secours Dublin is exploring AI in 2026, I’d suggest starting with a narrow, measurable workflow — for example, **nursing documentation/admin support** or **patient flow coordination** — with clear constraints (no unsupervised clinical advice; tight access controls; explicit evaluation).

Would you be open to a short call to understand where time is being lost today, and what would count as a genuine win for nursing?

Best,
`{{your_name}}`

LinkedIn connect note:

Hi Celine — I’m `{{your_name}}`. I focus on safety‑first AI pilots that reduce nursing/admin burden (no PHI-first approach, clear evaluation + governance). Would you be open to a brief chat?

## Mary Houston — Business Manager (Dublin)

Channel: LinkedIn or email via `dublininfo@bonsecours.ie` (Attn: Mary Houston).

Subject options:

- One operational AI pilot for Dublin (4–6 weeks)
- Reducing cancellations / DNAs: quick pilot proposal (no PHI)

Email draft:

Hi Mary,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). I help hospitals run small, low‑risk AI pilots focused on operational workflows.

For Bon Secours Dublin, I think there’s a strong early win in areas like **theatre cancellations** or **outpatient DNAs** — the kind of work where you can measure impact quickly and avoid any dependency on patient notes.

If helpful, I can share a short pilot plan (scope, guardrails, evaluation) and we can do a 25-minute call to confirm whether it’s worth pursuing.

Best,
`{{your_name}}`

LinkedIn connect note:

Hi Mary — I’m `{{your_name}}`. I run practical AI pilots for hospital ops (cancellations/DNAs/scheduling) with clear evaluation and low data risk. Would you be open to a quick call?

## Mary Kirwan — Head of HR (Dublin)

Channel: LinkedIn (primary) or email via `dublininfo@bonsecours.ie`.

Subject options:

- AI adoption in hospitals: what to train, what to forbid
- Practical AI upskilling plan (clinical + admin)

Email draft:

Hi Mary,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). A lot of “AI projects” fail because staff don’t get clear guidance: what’s allowed, what isn’t, and how to use tools safely.

If Bon Secours Dublin is interested, I can share a lightweight **AI acceptable‑use + training** package aimed at hospital realities (privacy, clinical safety, auditability), paired with one small pilot so learning happens in a real workflow.

If you can point me to the right person (or if this is you), I’d appreciate 20 minutes.

Best,
`{{your_name}}`

LinkedIn connect note:

Hi Mary — I help hospitals roll out AI safely via simple rules + role‑based training, paired with one practical pilot. Would you be open to a short chat?

## Mary Stenson — Financial Controller (Dublin)

Channel: LinkedIn or email via `dublininfo@bonsecours.ie`.

Subject options:

- AI pilots without the usual spend or risk
- Quick ROI test: one workflow, 6 weeks, measurable outcome

Email draft:

Hi Mary,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). I work on making AI investments in hospitals **testable**: small scope, clear evaluation, and a stop/go decision that doesn’t rely on vendor claims.

If Bon Secours Dublin is considering AI, I’d propose a single workflow pilot (e.g., cancellations/DNAs) with a short evaluation plan so you can quantify the impact before any larger commitment.

Would you be open to a brief call, or can you point me to the right owner for operational improvement?

Best,
`{{your_name}}`

Email draft:

Hi Alan,

I’m `{{your_name}}` (`{{your_title}}`). I’m building an Ireland-first approach to hospital AI adoption that is practical: **small pilots** paired with **governance and evaluation** so lessons scale safely.

Bon Secours is well-positioned to do this across the group. If helpful, I can share a simple playbook: pilot selection criteria, safety posture, security/privacy checklist, and a repeatable evaluation method.

Would you be open to a short call, or should I start with the group CIO?

Best,
`{{your_name}}`

## Follow-ups (use for any thread)

Follow-up 1 (3–5 business days):

Hi {{name}} — quick follow-up. If it’s useful, I can send a one‑page pilot outline (scope, guardrails, evaluation). If you’re not the right owner, who would you suggest I speak with?

Follow-up 2 (7–10 business days):

Hi {{name}} — last note from me. I’m planning outreach calls for February and I’m happy to tailor this to whichever workflow matters most (theatre / outpatients / radiology ops). If there’s no fit right now, no problem.
