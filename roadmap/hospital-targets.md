# Hospital targets (initial outreach)

This is a shortlist to focus outreach and pilot work.

## How I’m ranking

I’m prioritizing hospitals where a first pilot + credible reference is most likely:

1. **Influence**: national importance, teaching status, referral patterns
2. **Reach**: ability to scale across a hospital group/network
3. **AI-suitability**: high-volume workflows where AI can help quickly (radiology, oncology, ops, documentation)
4. **Speed**: decision-making and procurement velocity (often faster in private hospitals)

## Tier 1 — Anchor institutions (credibility)

These are the “name-brand” hospitals that signal national relevance.

- St James’s Hospital (Dublin)
- Beaumont Hospital (Dublin)
- Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (Dublin)
- St Vincent’s University Hospital (Elm Park, Dublin)
- Cork University Hospital (Cork)

## Tier 2 — Regional university hospitals (national coverage)

These provide geographic breadth and large patient volumes.

- Tallaght University Hospital (Dublin)
- University Hospital Galway (Galway)
- University Hospital Limerick (Limerick)
- University Hospital Waterford (Waterford)
- Mayo University Hospital (Castlebar)

## Tier 3 — Fast-pilot private “high-tech” hospitals

These can be strong for early pilots and case studies (speed + operational focus).

- Beacon Hospital (Dublin)
- Blackrock Clinic (Dublin)
- Mater Private Hospital (Dublin)
- Hermitage Clinic / Hermitage Medical Clinic (Dublin)
- Galway Clinic (Blackrock Health Galway Clinic) (Galway)
- UPMC Kildare Hospital (Clane)
- UPMC Whitfield Clinic (Waterford)

## Specialist angles (good “wedge” entry points)

If you want a narrow, high-ROI starting point:

- Radiotherapy/oncology: St Luke’s Hospital (Rathgar) + radiotherapy network
- Orthopaedics: Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital
- Rehab: National Rehabilitation Hospital (Dún Laoghaire)
- Eye: Royal Victoria Eye & Ear Hospital
