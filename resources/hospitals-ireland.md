## Notes on completeness and scope

- The lists above focus on hospitals and major clinics providing inpatient or day‑case procedures, maternity and paediatric care, psychiatric and rehabilitation services, and specialist surgery (orthopaedic, ophthalmic, oncology, etc.). Small general‑practice clinics and primary‑care centres are not included because they number in the thousands and are not typically classified as hospitals.
- Several hospitals operate under networks or groups (e.g., Bon Secours Health System, UPMC, Saolta University Health Care Group). Facilities branded as "day hospitals" or "clinics" are included when they provide surgical or specialist care.
- Health‑insurance lists used as primary sources were current as of 1 December 2025, and the FOI voluntary‑hospital register was accessed in February 2026.
